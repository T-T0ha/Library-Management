ðŸ”§ Fix the Port Conflict
First, let's see what's currently running on port 8081:
ss -tlnp | grep 8081

I can see that there's already a Node.js process (PID 16549) running on port 8081. This is likely your BookService that's already running. Let me kill that process and then answer your questions about restarting configurations.
kill 16549

Perfect! I killed the process that was blocking port 8081. Now your BookService should be able to start properly.

ðŸ“‹ To Answer Your Question About Restarting Configurations:
No, you don't need to restart the entire Nginx configuration every time! Here are the different scenarios:

For Nginx Configuration Changes:
Option 1: Reload (Recommended - No Downtime)
sudo nginx -s reload


Option 2: Test then Reload
sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration first
sudo nginx -s reload  # Apply changes if test passes

Option 3: Full Restart (Only if reload doesn't work)
sudo nginx -s stop
sudo nginx -c /path/to/your/nginx.conf
